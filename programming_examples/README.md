# MLIR-AIR Programming Examples

These programming examples are provided so that application programmers can learn how to leverage the AIR design flow with mlir-air python bindings, as well as the mlir-air intermediate representation (IR) directly, to build applications targeting AI Engines.

## [2-Dimensional Shim DMA Passthrough](shim_dma_2d)

This example demonstrates how data may be moved using shim DMA operations. It also includes extra infrastructure that illustrates different ways to compile, build, run, and test programs written using the mlir-air python bindings.

## [Passthrough Examples](passthrough)

Three examples that copy data from the input to the output (a data passthrough). The data movement is done through either DMA or Channels, and there is a simple example of calling a an external function which performs a vectorized memcopy.

## [Channel Examples](channel_examples)

This is a collection of simple examples that illustrate how to use channels.

## [Matrix Scalar Addition](matrix_scalar_add)

This example provides logic to divide in input 2D matrix into *tiles* of data, and add a value to every element in every tile. It includes some description of the fundamental concepts of mlir-air, including *launches*, *herds*, and *channels*.

## [Data Transfer Transpose](data_transfer_transpose)

Transposes a matrix with using either Channels or `dma_memcpy_nd`.
